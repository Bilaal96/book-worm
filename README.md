# üìñ Book Worm üêõ

## Project Overview

Book Worm is an app that allows users to keep track of their favourite books as well as a reading list (or "to be read" list). I will retrieve book data from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) and user's will be able to filter the books data via a search box.

This project serves as learning grounds for Material UI, as well as React practice. I intend to learn and use Node.js & Express to implement user auth.

Future additions will include:

- integration with [Embedded Viewer API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/viewer/developers_guide) (also by Google).
- list of "quick access" checkbox filters that users can toggle to filter the books displayed

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
